## How to Add a Stripe Payment Method 

This guide is intended to help Developers add a Stripe payment to their Plug-ins for marketplace Admins. With the addition of the Stripe payment method, you can make your Arcadier Plug-In require payment either on a subscription plan or a one-time fee. This will be a step by step guide on how to add a Stripe payment method to your Plug-Ins.

If you do not have a Stripe account, please go to their [homepage](https://stripe.com/en-sg?&utm_campaign=paid_brand-SG_en_Search_Brand_Stripe&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&ad_content=301266036615&utm_term=stripe&utm_matchtype=e&utm_adposition1t1&utm_device=c&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3uboBRDCARIsAO2XcYAvCHyVJVdkKpY27rpxOXvB4kkymiuAAO01RgHZC64I3hNqAqGHbaAaAvsREALw_wcB) and create one. Once you have your Stripe account, please take note of your account’s publishable key and secret key. To obtain your Stripe’s publishable key and secret key, navigate to “Developers” > “API keys” on your Stripe Dashboard. Out of the two keys, you will have to manually reveal your secret key to retrieve it.
